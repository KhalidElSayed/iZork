1. Welcome to iZork, adventurer. You are standing at the southwest edge of a forest. Your destiny awaits you within, but dangers lurk everywhere. To help you on your journey, the gods have gifted you with armor and a sword. You may choose to take these items. Or, you may leave them behind. If you take them, use them wisely. However, if you leave them, the gods may take offense and punish you for your ingratitude... [HINT: HEAD NORTH FIRST]
2. After walking a bit, the forest thickens. All manner of strange fauna rustle, grunt, and screech, just outside your eyeshot. But you press on, and the effort of hacking through the brush makes you hungry. Fortunately, you spy a stash of lovely looking nuts and berries nestled in the hollow of a tree stump. You may choose to eat them, take them as supplies for later, or leave them behind. Choose wisely.
3. Suddenly, the noises stop. You freeze in a small clearing, and listen. Something isn't right. HOWL! A wolf bounds out of the trees and lands on all fours right in front of you! What do you choose? You can attack the wolf, you can try to defend yourself from attack, or you can run away (and risk damage in retreat).
4. The favor of the gods was with you in your last encounter! Having survived the threat, you stop to rest in a meadow at the west edge of the forest.   You bandage your wounds, and as you take stock of your supplies, you notice a scrap of paper on the ground. It reads: "Our fortunes lie to the north, but our destiny... to the east."
